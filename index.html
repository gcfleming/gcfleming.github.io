<!-- GEOM101 Assignment 2 Website - Grace Cavanagh -->
<!-- I decided to make a simple website about my new puppy so I could focus most of the time on
the html and css rather than search for content and come up with information - so hopefully you
don't care too much about the words cause they're pretty dumb. -->
<!-- The 3 options I chose are -
	1. Navigation Bar
	2. 3 External Links
	3. 5 Original Images at Native Size
	I will indicate when these each begin and end -->
