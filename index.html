<!-- GEOM101 Assignment 2 Website - Grace Cavanagh -->
<!-- I decided to make a simple website about my new puppy so I could focus most of the time on the html and css 
rather than search for content - so hopefully the content doesn't matter too much cause it's not the best. -->
<!-- The 3 options I chose are -
	1. Navigation Bar
	2. 3 External Links
	3. 5 Original Images at Native Size (I did 8 to make it look even)
	I will indicate when these each begin and end, and will indicate if something didn't work how I wanted -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<!-- I used https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp to indicate this website is in English -->
<html lang="en">
	<head>
        	<!-- title for the tab and linking the external css sheet from github -->
		<title>Penny's Resume</title>
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
	</head>	
	<body>
		<!-- this heading is the same for both pages -->
		<h1>Penny Cavanagh</h1>
		
		<!-- start of 1. NAVIGATION BAR on page one, heavily helpec by w3schools at https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar_horizontal.asp -->
		<!-- creates a white navbar with two pages, one active and the other my relative path to 2nd page -->
		<div class="navbar">
			<a class="active" href="index.html">Home</a>
			<a href="aboutme.html">More About Me</a>
		</div> 
		<!-- end of 1. NAVIGATION BAR page one -->
		
		<!-- first section of page, using help from w3 schools Grid page I made a grid, attempting to organize my
		dysfunctional layout - https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp -->
		<div class="grid-top">
			<div class="grid-item">
				<!-- I only wanted two columns up top, so I made two different grids for the bottom and top of my page -->
				<!-- left side of top grid with resume text, including two unordered lists that didn't go how I wanted but I'll explain in the CSS -->
				<h2>Interests</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Chex Cereal</li>

				<!-- two education inputs with the span bolding the type of training, and centering the dates underneath -->

				<h2>Current Project</h2>
				<!-- Out of any possible problem I don't know how this and the p on my aboutme.html page were the biggest issues. I still
				haven't been able to properly center this -->
				<p>At the moment I'm working on remembering that I was taught how to sit, and to not beg for people food.</p>

			<!-- right side of top grid with picture - start 3. At least 5 IMAGES AT NATIVE SIZE -->

			</div>
			<!-- end 3. At least 5 IMAGES AT NATIVE SIZE on first page, more on aboutme.html -->

			<!-- I used an id for this because I wanted to emphasize this particular heading and because it didn't look good with the original h2 css -->
			<h2 id="BottomHeading">Adopt a Puppy Like Me!</h2>
		<!-- start of 2. THREE EXTERNAL LINKS, I made another grid with more columns for links again with https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp and made a 
		specific class for p in grid-bottom so links could center. I also created a class in css that only changes the look of external links on any page, 
		got help from https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.php -->
