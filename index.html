<!-- GEOM101 Assignment 2 Website - Grace Cavanagh -->
<!-- I decided to make a simple website about my new puppy so I could focus most of the time on
the html and css rather than search for content and come up with information - so hopefully you
don't care too much about the words cause they're pretty dumb! -->
<!-- The 3 options I chose are -
	1. Navigation Bar
	2. 3 External Links
	3. 5 Original Images at Native Size
	I will indicate when these each begin and end -->

				<!-- grid-items are mostly the same in both the top and bottom grid, but 
				p kept taking precendence over the text-align and I only wanted two columns up top, so I

				<h2>Current Projects</h2>
				<p>I'm only 5 months old, so I haven't actually accomplished much yet. Currently I'm working on
				remembering that I was taught how to sit, and I've been told that unfortunately I have to stop yelling at people when
				they don't give me their food. So I plan to work on that in the future.</p>
