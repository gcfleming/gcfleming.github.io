		<!-- using w3 school's (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_image_gallery_scroll.asp) example of a scroll container I used 5 images I took of Penny that were changed to 
		size 600x400 before adding them to my Github repository. The example from w3 used 600x400 but i tried out a few sizes and decided
		600x400 was best for my selection as well-->
