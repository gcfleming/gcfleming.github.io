<!-- GEOM101 Assignment 2 Website - Grace Cavanagh -->
<!-- I decided to make a simple website about my new puppy so I could focus most of the time on
the html and css rather than search for content and come up with information. I see her every day so the
text was easy to come up with -->
<!-- The 3 options I chose are -
	1. Navigation Bar
	2. 3 External Links
	3. 5 Original Images at Native Size
	I will indicate when these each begin and end -->

<!-- put W3 schools here for english declaration -->

				<!-- grid-items are mostly the same in both the top and bottom grid, but 
				p kept taking precendence over the text-align and I only wanted two columns up top, so I
				made two different grids for the bottom and top of my page -->
